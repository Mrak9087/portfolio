              I have been working in IT since 2010. Mostly worked as a system administrator and as a
              programmer. At work I often had to program. I have experience in programming in
              Delphi. I created clients to work with databases: MS SQL, MySQL, Firebird. The
              institute had a course on HTMS, CSS. After graduation, I was engaged in page layout
              for some time. Participated in the development of the Institute's website. Iâ€™ve also
              created an application for learning languages on React and project management system
              Trello-clone on React + Typescript. I want to become a professional developer. I am
              ready to develop in this direction.
